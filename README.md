# Phone Pad Coding Challenge

Traverse a phone pad to generate all possible phone numbers. The numbers should only consist of digits that are horizontally or vertically next to each other.

Phone pad layout:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
  0
  ```
  
The solution is an Xcode Playground file written in Swift.
